This repo is a work in progress.  The basic chat room functionality works.  A user can create and subscribe to multiple chat rooms.  An email address is required to register a user, but it is not validated so any fake address will do.  Chat rooms and messages are persisted to a local SQLite 3 database.

Another objective of this project was to integrate a Bootstrap/Material Design theme into the Rails asset pipeline.  This part of the project is ongoing, so the styling is currently not very attractive.
